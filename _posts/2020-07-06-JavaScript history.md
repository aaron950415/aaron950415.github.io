## The unexpected birth of JavaScript
When it comes to the history of JavaScript, what I have to say is a version 0.9 of the **Navigator** browser. This is the first mature web browser in history. However, the company requires a web scripting language for a form requirement. And, because C++ was the most popular language at the time, and Java was the mainstream of Netscape. They asked *Brendan Eich* to write, "It looks similar to Java, but simpler than Java, so that non-professional web authors can quickly get started."

## Brendan Eich's feelings about JavaScript
He has no interest in Java at all. In order to cope with the tasks arranged by the company, he designed Javascript in only 10 days. So lay the groundwork for the following mistakes.

If it weren't for the company's decision, Brendan Eich could never use Java as a prototype for Javascript design. As a designer, he didn't like his work at all:

"It is better to say that I hate Javascript than I love it. It is the product of the one-night stand of C and Self. The 18th century English writer Dr. Johnson said well:'he part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good.'"

## The disadvantages of JavaScript design
It may be because when JavaScript was developed, it was not realized that it would be so popular. The usage of users showed an exponential increase, but there was no corresponding language specification. As a result, the Javascript specifications are solidified before they are adjusted. And at the end of the following year, in order to suppress the JavaScript scripting language of Microsoft, it was decided to promulgate international standards in 1997.

Generally speaking, the promulgated international standard will be much longer than normal use time, this is to avoid the uncorrected BUG during the use period. Take the C language as a comparison. It has been published for nearly 20 years before international standards were promulgated. In the same way, JavaScript was released only a year and a half ago, and design flaws have become the standard before the flaws are fully exposed.

## Thinking
Currently, only JavaScript is a scripting language on the market that has survived, and there are many frameworks based on it. This also led to its current irreplaceable status. At the beginning of development, there was no rival, but it still required nearly five years to unify the Internet. What about now? In every industry that needs to design web pages, JavaScript is still irreplaceable. In the future, there may be a better scripting language than JavaScript, but its development will be more limited by the scope of JavaScript, thereby extending the diffusion cycle of the new scripting language. Therefore, we still need to work hard to learn what we need to learn, don't worry about what to do if JavaScript is outdated, and what to do with better tools.
