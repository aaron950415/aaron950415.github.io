# Github Pages

GitHub Pages is a function provided by GitHub to display static web pages hosted on GitHub. In short, through it we can preview all web pages in the current code repository. Using this feature, users can also build their own personal blog.

# How to use GitHub Pages

- Suppose we have uploaded a local repository to GitHub, we open this repository in Github, and there is already an HTML file in the repository.

- Next we turn on the GitHub Pages function, click Settings, scroll down to find GitHub Pages, select the master branch, and then GitHub Pages is already open

- We can see a link provided by GitHub Pages, copy this link, and add `index.html` `(aaron950415.github.io/learning/â€¦)` to preview our web page

- In fact, even if you do not add index.html later, you can successfully preview it. GitHub Pages will access index.html by default. If you want to preview other webpages, you must add the corresponding path.
