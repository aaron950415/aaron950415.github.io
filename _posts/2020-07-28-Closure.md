## What closure is 
Closure is the use of variables declared outside the function inside the function, for example:

```javascript
  let a = 1
  let b = function(){
      console.log(a)
  }
```

## Use of closures
Closures can be used in many places. It has two biggest uses, one is to read the variables inside the function mentioned earlier, and the other is to keep the values of these variables in memory.
```javascript
　　function f1(){
　　　　var n=999;
　　　　nAdd=function(){n+=1}
　　　　function f2(){
　　　　　　alert(n);
　　　　}
　　　　return f2;
　　}
　　var result=f1();
　　result(); // 999
　　nAdd();
　　result(); // 1000
```

## Disadvantages of closures

1. Since closures will cause the variables in the function to be stored in memory, which consumes a lot of memory, closures should not be abused, otherwise it will cause performance problems of the web page and may cause memory leaks in IE.

2. The closure will be outside the parent function, changing the value of the variable inside the parent function. Therefore, if you use the parent function as an object, the closure as its public method, and the internal variable as its private property, you must be careful not to change the value of the internal variable of the parent function.
