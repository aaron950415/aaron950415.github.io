# Before Start

This article provides to some people who do not technology and want to build a blog. The advantage is free for building and depend on Github.

# Quick Start

## register Github account

- The first thing is register a account in Github, I think no one will be stopped in here.

### (Notice: your account do not mix uppercase and lowercase or it will cause problems when creating a blog.)

- secondly, when you complete, you can entry home. And then click the drop-down menu in the upper right and choose new repository.

- Thirdly,set repository name, this name must be (your account).github.io, and then create repository.

  The alert is because I had created before.

- Then, congratulations on your successful blog. Your blog address is `https://(your account).github.io/`. You can change your content in the `index.html`.

In addition, if you discover your blog don't work, like this:

That's your repository name is not same as account name. I notice before, if your account mix uppercase and lowercase, the website can not identify your address.

Hope everyone has your blog.
